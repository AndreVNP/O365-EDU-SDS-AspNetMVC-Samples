## Sample Goals

The sample demonstrates:

* Data models supporting [OneRoster entities](https://www.imsglobal.org/oneroster-v11-final-specification#_Toc480452006)
* Action controllers supporting [OneRoster service endpoints](https://www.imsglobal.org/oneroster-v11-final-specification#_Toc480451989)
* Authorization middleware supporting [OneRoster Core Security](https://www.imsglobal.org/oneroster-v11-final-specification#_Toc480452001)
* Generation of [OneRoster CSV bundles](https://www.imsglobal.org/oneroster-v11-final-csv-tables)
* Consumption of [SDS Profile Management APIs](https://github.com/OfficeDev/O365-EDU-Tools/tree/master/SDSProfileManagementDocs) to create and start SDS sync profiles

OneRosterProviderDemo is based on ASP.NET Core Web.

## Build and debug locally

This project can be opened with the edition of Visual Studio 2017 you already have, or download and install the Community edition to run, build and/or develop this application locally.

- [Visual Studio 2017 Community](https://www.visualstudio.com/thank-you-downloading-visual-studio/?sku=Community)

Debug **OneRosterProviderDemo**:

1. Configure **appsettings.json**.

   ![](Images/web-app-config.png)

   - **AzureAd:Authority**: "https://login.microsoftonline.com/{your-ad-tenant}.onmicrosoft.com/"
   - **AzureAd:ClientId**: use the Client Id of the app registration you created earlier.
   - **AzureAd:ClientSecret**: use the Key value of the app registration you created earlier.
   - **AzureDomain**: use your AD tenant domain, which should agree with the **AzureAd:Authority** entry

2. In the Package Manager Console, run the command `EntityFrameworkCore\Update-Database` to generate the initial database. If this causes an error, try running the command `Import-Package Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore`.
3. Set **OneRosterProviderDemo** as StartUp project, and press F5.
4. Visit `/seeds` to populate your database with sample entities. Make sure to access the endpoint using HTTPS.

## Deploy the sample to Azure

1. Create a Publish Profile

  - Select **Build > Publish OneRosterProviderDemo**
  - Click **Create new profile**
  - Select **Microsoft Azure App Service** and **Create New**
  - Click **Publish**
  - Sign into your Azure account
  - Select a Resource Group for the deploy, or create a new one by clicking **New**
  - Select an App Service Plan for the deploy, or create a new one by clicking **New**
  - Click **Create**

2. Select **Build > Publish OneRosterProviderDemo**
3. Click **Publish**

**Add REPLY URL to the app registration**

1. After the deployment, open the resource group in Azure Portal
2. Click the web app.

   ![](Images/azure-web-app.png)

   Copy the URL aside and change the schema to **https**, and add **/signin-oidc** to the end. This is the reply URL and will be used in next step.

3. Navigate to the app registration in the new azure portal, then open the setting windows.

   Add the reply URL:

   ![](Images/aad-add-reply-url.png)

   > Note: to debug the sample locally, make sure that https://localhost:44344/signin-oidc is in the reply URLs.

4. Click **SAVE**.

## Sync with SDS

There are two synchronization options, via the OneRoster REST endpoints, and by uploading [SDS compliant CSV files](https://support.office.com/en-us/article/CSV-files-for-School-Data-Sync-9f3c3c2b-7364-4f6e-a959-e8538feead70).

### Sync with OneRoster REST
1. Visit your deploy at /sds
2. Sign in with an admin account on your education tenant.
3. Verify that the "OneRoster endpoint" value agrees with your deployed instance
  - Note that this will not work unless your URL is publicly accessible
4. Click the "Sync via OneRoster REST" button

### Sync with SDS CSV
1. Visit your deploy at /sds
2. Sign in with an admin account on your education tenant.
3. Select your SDS CSV files
4. Click the "Sync via SDS CSV" button

## Understand the code

### Introduction

This web application is based on an ASP.NET Core Web project template.

### Authorization

#### OneRoster Endpoints
The `Middlewares/OAuth.cs` file defines a middleware that validates the OAuth1 or OAuth2 signature for each incoming request with a OneRoster route.  This file also contains the hard-coded client ID and secret.
In order to make OAuth2 requests, first visit the /token endpoint using OAuth1 credentials to get the access token.
The `Startup.cs` file configures the app to use this middleware.

#### SDS Profile Management
The `Startup.cs` file configures the app to use .NET Core's OpenIDConnect (oidc) library.  This flow is handled by `AccountController`.

### Data Models

Most of the OneRoster models have a corresponding model class in the `Models` directory.  Due to language naming conventions, some of these have been renamed.  The mapping of models is shown in the table below.

| OneRoster Model        | EFCore Model      |
|------------------------|-------------------|
| Base                   | BaseModel         |
| Academic Session       | AcademicSession   |
| Class                  | IMSClass          |
| Course                 | Course            |
| Demographic Data       | Demographic       |
| Enrollment             | Enrollment        |
| Line Item              | LineItem          |
| Line Item Category     | LineItemCategory  |
| Org                    | Org               |
| Resource               | Resource          |
| Result                 | Result            |
| User, Student, Teacher | User              |

Additional models were created to support various needs:

| EFCore Model            | Purpose                                         |
|-------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| IMSClassAcademicSession | Join table for Class, Term (Academic Session)   |
| UserAgent               | Join table for User, User                       |
| UserOrg                 | Join table for User, Org                        |
| UserId                  | Shape of user ids                               |
| SeedData                | Holds seed data for initial database population |
| OauthNonce              | Stores nonce values to disallow reuse           |

### Validation

Validation requirements are defined in the [OneRoster model specification](https://www.imsglobal.org/oneroster-v11-final-specification#_Toc480452006).

In addition to the validation attributes supplied by .NET and ASP Core, there are four custom validators for properties with specific requirements in the `Validators` folder.

#### Vocabulary
[Vocabularies](https://www.imsglobal.org/oneroster-v11-final-specification#_Toc480452048) used by OneRoster, including [enumerations](https://www.imsglobal.org/oneroster-v11-final-specification#_Toc480452020), are provided by the `Vocabulary/Vocabulary` class.

The subject code vocabulary "SCEDv4.0" is published by [NCES](https://nces.ed.gov/forum/SCED.asp); a conversion of the published spreadsheet is present in the `Vocabulary/sced-v4.csv` file, which is parsed at startup time.

### Customized Serialization

All response json objects are written using the NewtonSoft JSON nuget package, for the purposes of matching the [prescribed json bindings](https://www.imsglobal.org/oneroster-v11-final-specification#_Toc480452033).

All entities that can be serialized into a service endpoint response support two serialization methods, `AsJson` and `AsJsonReference`.

**AsJson** is used when the entity is the primary entity, or a member of the primary collection, that was requested.

**AsJsonReference** is used to express the entity as a [GUIDRef](https://www.imsglobal.org/oneroster-v11-final-specification#_Toc480452031).

### Pagination, Filtering, and Sorting

The `Controllers/BaseController` class hooks in [paging, filtering, and sorting](https://www.imsglobal.org/oneroster-v11-final-specification#_Toc480451994).

Filtering and sorting are implemented in the model classes via reflection in order to support the requirement that any data field be usable for filtering or sorting.

### Data Source

An SQLite database is assumed and configured in `Startup.cs`.

You can create a new, empty database by running the `EntityFrameworkCore\Update-Database` command in the Package Manager console, and seed it with sample data by visiting the `/seeds` endpoint.

## Supported OneRoster Endpoints

There are three OneRoster v1.1 service subsets, defined [here](https://www.imsglobal.org/oneroster-v11-final-specification#_Toc480451989).  Of these, the Rostering (read-only) and Gradebook (read-and-write) subsets are implemented by this sample.

## Unsupported Features
